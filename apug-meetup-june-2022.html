<p>This will be a physical meetup, although online access via Zoom will be provided for those who require it.</p>
<p>The talk for this month is</p>
<h2>Open Data Scotland - Crowdsourcing and aggregating open datasets across the country</h2>
<p><a href="https://opendata.scot">Open Data Scotland</a> is an open-source, collaborative, and volunteer run project which helps people locate and understand Open Data in Scotland better. The project which emerged from a weekend hack event at <a href="https://codethecity.org/ctc23-the-future-of-the-city/">Code The City 23</a> has now been in operation for 1 year and involves pulling data from various data sources; cleaning, processing and collating the data into a standardised store; then publishing the data to an interactive frontend, along with hosted data visualisations. All of this, is to help the public understand what Open Data is available in Scotland</p>
<p>Until CTC26 in May 2022 most of these were manual processed, but these have now been automated using Github Actions which run Python Scrapers and API calls.</p>
<p>Jack, Karen, and Rob will walk through how python and github were used for different parts of the project and open up about the challenges they faced along the way. </p>
<h2>Group Coding Challenge(s)</h2>
<p>After the talks we will have group coding challenges. </p>
<h2>Speaker Bios</h2>
<h3>Jack Gilmore</h3>
<p>Jack is a full stack software developer with experience of working in the public sector and academia. He graduated with a BSc (Hons) in Computing Science and Spanish from the University of Stirling in 2019. As an advocate of free and open-source software, many of the projects he has worked on either consume or produce open data. Most recently, making use of his skillset with GIS datasets Jack helped create <a href="https://openwastemap.uk/">OpenWasteMap</a>, a web application which uses data from OpenStreetMap to display recycling centre locations, their accepted materials and opening hours.</p>
<h3>Karen Jewell</h3>
<p>Karen is a Data Scientist with a background in Business Management and Analytics, having spent the last 12 years designing, building, and testing data products which help people make decisions. She studied a BA in Business Management and a MSc in Data Science at Robert Gordon University, and is currently studying, again, for a BSc in Mathematics and Statistics at the Open University. In her spare time, Karen also serves on the board of trustees for CodeTheCity, works on the <a href="www.opendata.scot">Open Data Scotland</a> project, runs half-marathon races, and maintains a 630+ day streak on Duolingo learning Scottish Gaelic.</p>
