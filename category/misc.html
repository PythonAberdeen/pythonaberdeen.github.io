Please note our <a href="https://codethecity.org/policy-for-reducing-the-spread-of-infectious-diseases/">policy on reducing the spread of infectious diseases</a> such as Covid-19.</p>
<p>The format is (roughly)</p>
<ul>
<li>18:00 Pizza for those who are joining us in person</li>
<li>18:30 Talk - "Web Scraping with Python for research" - Ian Watt</li>
<li>19:15 A practical challenge</li>
<li>20:30 Project round-ups</li>
</ul>
<h2>Web Scraping with Python for research</h2>
<p>In this session we will introduce the basics of using Python to scrape data from web sites.</p>
<p>Then we will have a set of practical challenges where you will tasked with creating a scraper to help with a real-world academic research project. You'll then upload that code to GitHub.</p>
<p>If you don’t already have Python set up, we can help you with that too. Coding in pairs or small groups (especially mixing beginner and more experiences coders) is strongly encouraged, though you can also code solo.</p>
<p>This event is orgnanised by a charity - Code The City. CTC suggests a small donation to help with charity admin costs, but if this is a barrier please just change the ticket price to what you can afford.</p>
<p>We're now back to running physical events backed up with an online option.</p>
<p>If you select a physical ticket and it happens that we can not meet physically you will have to attend the Zoom session. If you choose a physical ticket and it goes ahead you will have to comply with any conditions of attendance (eg masks or social distancing) that the venue operators demand at the time.</p>
<p>Those attending the physical space meetup should attend at 6pm for pizza and drinks. The coding session (for online attendees) will be from 6.30pm. Doors will be locked from 6.30pm.</p>
