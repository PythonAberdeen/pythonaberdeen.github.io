## This month's APUG session

Our January session will take place on 12 January 2022. It will start at 18:30. 

The format is 


* 18:30 Talk: Anjana Wijekoon - "Reuse, Create and Publish Python Packages"
* 19:00 Project teams in break-out rooms (Beginner and Intermediate). 
* 20:30 Project round-ups

### Description

A python package can be as simple as a single function or as complex as multiple modules of functions. In Machine Learning where I use Python the most, a few popular packages are Numpy, Pandas and Scikit-learn. They allow us to “not reinvent the wheel” and focus more on our own tasks. Python Community maintain an index of packages for developers to reuse. Python Package Index (PyPI) is the main index where these packages are listed. I will talk about how to use existing python packages, how to create your own python package and how to publish it on PyPI so other can reuse them.

### Biography
Anjana Wijekoon is a Research Fellow working in the AI and Reasoning research group. Currently, she is working on Explainable AI with the chist-era funded iSEE project. Her PhD (2021) looked at the personalisation of human activity recognition algorithms with multi-modal sensors for building self-management solutions for patients with musculoskeletal conditions. During her PhD, Anjana contributed as a Research Assistant for SelfBACK and FitChat projects. Prior to RGU, she completed a MSc in Computer Science and a BSc Eng (Hons) in Computer Science and Engineering from University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. She also has 5+ years of experience in the Software Engineering industry working on electronic patient health record systems.
