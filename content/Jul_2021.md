## "Green Thumb Tech: Using a Raspberry Pi to monitor your house plants"

by Euan Wielewski

## Description

It's safe to say I don't have a green thumb. Every plant I'd owned had died, until I deployed some green thumb tech! In this talk I'll show you how I used a Raspberry Pi, a GROW Hat and Python to overcome my lack of a green thumb. I'll take you through how to monitor the moisture levels in your plant soil, store and analyse that data in the cloud, and set up automated alerts letting you know when you need to water your plants.

## Biography

Euan is the CEO and co-founder of Filament, a cloud-based Python workspace that makes it easy to analyse data, automate tasks, and share your work with others. He has a MEng from the University of Glasgow, a PhD from the University of Oxford, and has worked in a wide range of tech-related roles.

We will be back in July - watch this space.
