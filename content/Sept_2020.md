The format is

* 19:00 Project teams in break-out rooms (Beginner and Intermediate). 
* 20:30 Project round-ups

With limited open data available from official sources, few APIs we can query, it is often necessary to obtain data through scraping. That is using Python libraries to interact with webpages, find pieces of data and retrieve those. In this talk Ian will explain the tools, techniques, and approaches that can be helpful as well as poining out legal issues along the way. The Intermediate challenge will see you build your own scraper as Ian has outlined and retrieve some data from a webpage .... or seven.

The project challenges will be annopunced on [Github](https://github.com/PythonAberdeen/user_group/tree/master/)
