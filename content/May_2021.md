### Stop Playing With Your Self: An Intro to Functional Programming in Python

What is functional programming? How do you know when to use it instead of OOP? This will be a brief introduction to what you can do in Python without having to use "self". 

Zoe is a software engineer at Exizent, a mediocre crocheter and a bit of a nerd. After 2 years in the industry she now writes code and does platform ops in a small team of awesome people, while making everyone sigh in exasperation at her dad-teir puns.
