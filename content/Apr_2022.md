## This month's APUG session

Our next session will take place on 13 April 2022. It will start at 18:00. 

The format is 

* 18:00 Food (physical space)
* 18:30 Code kata practice
* 20:30 Kata round-ups

all times are approximate.

### Description

In this month's session, we will practice a "code kata".

"Code Kata is an attempt to bring this element of practice to software development. A kata is an exercise in karate where you repeat a form many, many times, making little improvements in each. The intent behind code kata is similar. Each is a short exercise (perhaps 30 minutes to an hour long)." - [CodeKata.com](www.codekata.com)

We will have both a physical and online version of this meetup.  If you select a physical ticket and it happens that we can not meet physically you will have to attend the Zoom session. If you choose a physical ticket you will have to comply with any conditions of attendance (eg masks or social distancing) that the venue operators demand at the time.
