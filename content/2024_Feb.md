* 19:15 A practical challenge
* 20:30 Project round-ups

## Spread The Word in Python

In this talk, Dr Carlos Moreno-Garcia (School of Computing RGU) will show a simple code to manipulate files using Python and "spread a message" across multiple directories. This message can be anything, from a watermark or even extra code which improves (or not!) other files. Standard Python packages will be used in a virtual environment to ensure there's no damage in your operating system!

## Challenge

The talk will be followed by a challenge which attendees can work on in small groups or solo.

So, if you can, bring a laptop or other device that you can run Python on. If you donâ€™t already have Python set up, we can help you with that too. Coding in pairs or small groups (especially mixing beginner and more experiences coders) is strongly encouraged, though you can also code solo.
