## Python and Data in Code The City's nine year history -  Ian Watt

Over almost a decade Code The City have been working on improving the availabilty of open data across Scotland. 

From scraping leisure centre timetables, to recording data on air quality at scale; from importing 25,000+ records of ship wrecks around our coast into Wikidata to setting up a national portal for open data, we've covered a lot of ground. 

And much of that work has relied, and continues to rely on, having scrapers which gather data for re-purposing as publicly-available open data. 

Join us to hear more, to get involved in fixing scrapers, and to look forward to projects tee'd up for CTC28 next week. 

If you donâ€™t already have Python set up, we can help you with that too. Coding in pairs or small groups (especially mixing beginner and more experiences coders) is strongly encouraged, though you can also code solo.
