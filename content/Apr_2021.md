### Writing Excel Add-ins in Python

Learn how to integrate Python into Microsoft Excel and write Excel add-ins in Python with the PyXLL Excel add-in.

In this talk we will look at how and why to write Excel add-ins in Python and some common use cases. We will also look at writing Excel worksheet functions (User Defined Functions) and macros, using Jupyter notebooks embedded in Excel, and how we can use Pandas to make spreadsheets simpler.

Tony has been in the finance industry for over 15 years. He worked as a developer for boutique hedge funds through to some of the largest financial firms before taking on the role of CTO at a successful fintech startup. In 2010 he launched PyXLL, an Excel Add-In with tens of thousands of users in a wide variety of industries, to bridge the gap between Python and Excel. In a previous life he developed graphics engines for console games.
