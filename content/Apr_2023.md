## Fingerpring Matching with Python - Dr Carlos Moreno-Garcia

Have you ever wondered how people applied computer vision BEFORE machine learning? 

Nowadays, it is very easy to compile thousands of images and train an algorithm to classify almost anything, but without massive amounts of data or high performance computers, people had to resort to clever tactics "back in the day". 

In this talk, Dr Carlos Moreno-Garcia (Senior Lecturer, RGU) will show a demo code to manually extract features from human fingerprints and perform matching for the recognition of individuals. 

These techniques still have relevance in areas such as biometrics, given the required precision and the few data samples at hand. 

After the demo, attendees will be encouraged to run the code and propose their own upgrades, so bring your computer/laptop for maximum engagement!


If you donâ€™t already have Python set up, we can help you with that too. Coding in pairs or small groups (especially mixing beginner and more experiences coders) is strongly encouraged, though you can also code solo.
