## "Async python" - Robert McWilliam

Robert will go through some of the async features of python - what it can be useful for and how to use it. 

### Biography

Robert is an electronic engineer who has used python for a variety of work and personal projects. 

## Challenge

After the talk at each APUG session we have a coding challenge for attendees - often based on the talk topic, and normally announced on the night. Challenges can be tackled in small groups or solo. 

So, if you can, bring a laptop or other device that you can run Python on. If you donâ€™t already have Python set up, we can help you with that too. Coding in pairs or small groups (especially mixing beginner and more experiences coders) is strongly encouraged, though you can also code solo.

### Registration
