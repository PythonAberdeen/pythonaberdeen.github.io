## "Exploring Companies data with Companies House API  and Python" -  Rory Gianni

A Python-based introduction to the Companies House API. This covers making requests and trying to gather data while overcoming the idiosyncrasies of the CH API.

### Biography

Rory is a technology trainer and consultant into all things creative and civic tech. Rory is co-founder of conversational AI company, inChat (https://inchat.design).  He recently started a blog and channel called Creating with Data which covers various data and visualisation topics.


## Challenge

After the talk at each APUG session we have a coding challenge for attendees - often based on the talk topic, and normally announced on the night. Challenges can be tackled in small groups or solo. 

So, if you can, bring a laptop or other device that you can run Python on. If you donâ€™t already have Python set up, we can help you with that too. Coding in pairs or small groups (especially mixing beginner and more experiences coders) is strongly encouraged, though you can also code solo.
