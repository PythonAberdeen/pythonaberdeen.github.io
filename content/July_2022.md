## Creating GUIs with PySimpleGUI - Mike Driscoll

Learn how to create cross-platform GUIs using Python and PySimpleGUI. In this talk, you will learn the basics of PySimpleGUI, and Mike will also show you how to access great demos and show a couple of small applications.

## Bio:

He has been writing about Python for many years on his blog, [The Mouse vs the Python](https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/). He has recently restarted [his Python Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/mousevspython/videos) too. His readers got him interested in writing books about Python and now Mike has ten books published! You can find Mike on Twitter at [https://twitter.com/driscollis](https://twitter.com/driscollis).
