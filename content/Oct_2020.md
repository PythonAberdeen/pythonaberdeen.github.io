The theme for October will be "Defining Classes: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming in Python" by Dr Lee A. Christie of RGU. 

Python is a deeply object-oriented language but doesn’t wear this on its sleeve quite as proudly as languages like Java or C++. If you’ve ever used Python, you’ve been using objects and classes! But have you tried defining your own class in Python? There are some differences between OOP in Python due to its duck-typing system. Do you know how to make your classes feel Pythonic, like the built-in types? This month’s talk will go over an introduction to object-oriented programming in Python, with OOP-related challenge projects.
