If you are new to Python we recommend this [free video course](https://youtu.be/_uQrJ0TkZlc) as a good starting point. 

It will take you through installing Python and getting started with the programming interface, understanding data types and concepts such as looping and iteration, right through to building three fairly large projects. 

While the whole course is 6 hours(!), you can cover most of the learning in the first three. You can pause and code along. 

If you want to join our monthly online sessions we suggest you've view most if not all of those three hours to get the most out of the [monthly set projects](https://github.com/PythonAberdeen/user_group) . 


We also _highly recommend_ the 4th Edition of Python Basics by David Amos, Dan Bader et al. See [our review](https://pythonaberdeen.github.io/pages/reviews.html) for further details.
